> Minecraft Rehauled started out as a datapack to mimick the feel of having mods. I found it actually more suitible for Minecraft Rehauled to be a mod.

# But what actually is Minecraft Rehauled?
> Minecraft Rehauled (Rehauled being a made up word symbolizing overhauled) **adds missing blocks, items, foods, armor, weapons and tools.** But not just server-side but client side too! What good is a mod for overhauling Minecraft if it's only server-side?

> **As of now, there aren't bunch of additions** in the mod version. But **in the (broken) [datapack version](https://github.com/ReactivePlayZ/Minecraft-Rehauled-Datapack/releases/tag/v1.0.4-dev) you can see some of the features that I had in mind**. With me using mods instead, it actually has given me more ideas for the additions. I want to keep everything mostly semi-vanilla, but if I were to make addons for this mod, then I'd make it mostly seem modded or less vanilla like.

# What it has right now/The current state of the mod
> As I am still learning, **the implementations and ideas I have in mind right now are very limited** to being featured in releases. But slowly I will be improving to add more and more.
**Everything there is right now is server-side** but in the near future there will be client side features.

> Also, you may some extra features not mentioned in the version release due to it being from the tutorial I am learning from. (I am not a professional if it wasn't clear)
